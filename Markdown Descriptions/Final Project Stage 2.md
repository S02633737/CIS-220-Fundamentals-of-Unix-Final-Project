# Stage 2
## Components:
- [Motion Sensor](https://www.componentsinfo.com/hc-sr501-module-pinout-datasheet/)
- LED
- 220 Î© Resistor

## Description:
At this stage, the device's function becomes more complex. Whenever the sensor is tripped, an led light will activate. After the thing that triggers it leaves the range, the light turns off. On my script for the first version, I had sleep for 5 seconds for every iteration of the infinite loop, but I disabled it for this version so it reads more accurately.
