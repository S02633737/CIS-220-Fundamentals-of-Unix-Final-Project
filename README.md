# CIS-220-Fundamentals-of-Unix-Final-Project
This is the Github repository for my final project
## Project Summary
My project consists of a 3-stage motion sensing circuit. The 1st stage was the sensor writing "Alarm" to the terminal screen. The 2nd stage added a red LED to turn on/off when motion was detected. The 3rd and final stage added a buzzer to go on and off when motion was detected. When all together, it makes a rudimentary motion detector. Some applications I can think of off the top of my head:
- A door alarm.
- An alarm on a car to make sure it doesn't come close enough to something else.
- Perimeter alarms.
There are several things you could use this for.
